# Hangman-Game

## Overview

For project #1, I created the simple game of 'Hangman'.

Once players come to the site, they will see a keyboard on the page. Below the keyboard, the drawing of a 'hangman' appears. As the player guesses letters, the correct lettter appears on the dashes. When the user guesses an incorrect letter, a different part of the 'hangman' appears. If the player wins, 'You Win' appears. If the player loses, the full drawing of the 'hangman' and 'Game Over' appears on the page.
